25,29.9,'Normal',"'Avoiding weight gain - Some treatments for type 2 diabetes, such as intensive insulin therapy and certain oral medications, can contribute to weight gain. The following tips can help you avoid unwanted weight gain:'"
25,29.9,'Normal',"'Weigh yourself on a regular basis (eg, every morning). If you gain more than 2 to 3 pounds in a week, try decreasing the number of calories you eat or increasing the amount of physical activity you do. Do not wait until you have gained a larger amount of weight, as this will make it harder to lose.'"
25,29.9,'Normal',"'As your blood sugar control improves with treatment, it may be necessary to somewhat decrease your daily calorie intake to avoid weight gain.'"
25,29.9,'Normal',"'If your blood sugar levels are frequently low at a particular time of day, your provider might suggest decreasing your dose of insulin or other medication rather than adding a snack at that time.'"
25,29.9,'High',"'Muscle cells have more insulin receptors than fat cells, so an individual can decrease insulin resistance by exercising. Being more active also lowers blood sugar levels by helping insulin to be more effective.'"

30,99.9,'Normal',"'Weight-loss occurs when energy expenditure exceeds energy intake. Creating a calorie deficit will result in weight-loss. Writing down the food, portion size and calorie amount in a food diary will help you become aware of the foods you consume and provide objective evidence of calorie intake.'"
30,99.9,'Normal',"'Meal timing - Consistently eating at the same times every day is important for some people, especially those who take long-acting insulin or oral medications that decrease blood sugar levels (sulfonylureas or meglitinides). If a meal is skipped or delayed while on these regimens, you are at risk for developing low blood glucose.'"
30,99.9,'Normal',"'If you use ""intensive"" insulin therapy (ie, if you give yourself multiple daily injections or use an insulin pump) or take certain other types of oral diabetes medications (eg, metformin), you may have more flexibility around meal timing. With these regimens, skipping or delaying a meal will not usually increase your risk of low blood sugar.'"
30,99.9,'Normal',"'While foods that are high in fat (eg, pizza) are OK to eat occasionally, you will need to monitor your blood sugar levels more closely. High-fat, high-protein meals are broken down more slowly than low-fat, lower-protein meals. When using rapid-acting insulin before a meal, your blood sugar level may become low shortly after eating a high-fat meal and then rise hours later. If you eat meals that contain more protein or fat than usual, you may need to make meal-time insulin dose adjustments to manage this delayed rise in blood sugar.'"
30,99.9,'High',"'Unhealthy eating is a contributor to obesity. Too much fat in your diet, not enough fiber and too many simple carbohydrates all contribute to the development of diabetes.'"
